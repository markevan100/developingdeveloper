     <p>'Imposter syndrome', a term I quickly became acquainted with in my exploration of the developement industry. In a dominated industry, a minority individual feels as if they are a 'fraud', constantly doubting their accomplishments or ability to succeed. I am a female minority entering a male dominated industry.
      </p>
       <p>I have yet to experience this first hand in the developement community. However, I have grown up playing sports, another common male dominated community, and have had to face this adversity my entire life. I find this challenge of standing out among men rather fuels instead of smoothers me.
        </p>
       <p>The outreach to gain more women and other minorities in the developement industry is a move in the right direction and a movement I want to be a part of. This desire for diversity can be seen in the overwhelming amount of scholarships offered to minorities who seek education in developement.
        </p>
     <h4>The Hunt</h4>
     <p>Finding an abundance of minority scholarships offered through specific schools was fairly quick and easy. At the top of my google search was <a href="https://www.switchup.org/blog/bootcamp-scholarship-list-2018" target="_blank">Switchup</a>, a resource that lists of many 2018 bootcamp scholarship offerings. A <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-scholarships-for-coding-bootcamp-students" target="_blank">Quora</a> search also offered quite an extensive list of program specific scholarships. And here is a list of even more, courtesy of <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/the-definitive-list-of-programming-bootcamp-scholarships" target="_blank">Course Report</a>!
    </p>
    <p>I am looking to attend <a href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing</a>, which is not on any of those lists. It is an inperson, 7 month program in the Denver area. They offer an easy $500 credit if you attend one of their <a href="https://turing.io/try-coding/" target="_blank">Try Coding</a> sessions! I did attend one, a full weekend where Saturday we covered back end and Sunday we covered front end. Look for a blog post on that experience in the future. They also appear to offer both a diversity scholarship and a GI Bill. Per cohort, Turing offers two $4,000 diversity scholarships,but one must inquire, by emailing erin@turing.io, to learn more and be enrolled to apply. I am still in the application process at this time, but will update this post as I hopefully progress. Turing also offers a new Mac Book Pro laptop with the tuition price. That's another pretty big bonus to me, as this is is the state of my current 2008 Mac Book Pro.
      </p>
     <p>Potentially, one could receive $4,500 to attend Turing. Unfortunately, Turing's tuition is $20,000. I don't have $15,000 between my couch cushions and do my best to remain debt free. There must be more money up for grabs from outside institutions or corporations, right?? This is proving harder to find than I thought...
     </p>
     <p>
       At a global level, I am not having much luck. Let me try a local level by searching within the Denver community. Still no luck...

         Not directly relevant to me, as I am 32 years old, but developer and model, Karlie Kloss, offers coding camps and scholarships through her program, <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/programs" target="_blank">Kode with Klossy</a>, to young womens ages 13-18. Pretty darn cool!
         </p>
         <p>
           If scholarships are not avaiable or perhaps granted to you, the schools claim to be partnered with good lending programs, some even have the option to defer payments till the end of your course, hopefully when you land that big bucks job. I still need to look more into these options as well.
