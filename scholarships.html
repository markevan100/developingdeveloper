     <p>'Imposter syndrome', a term I quickly became acquainted with in my exploration of the developement industry. In a dominated industry, a minority individual feels as if they are a 'fraud', constantly doubting their accomplishments or ability to succeed. I am a female minority entering a male dominated industry.
      </p>
       <p>I have yet to experience this first hand in the developement community. However, I have grown up playing sports, another common male dominated community, and have had to face this adversity my entire life. I find this challenge of standing out among men rather fuels instead of smoothers me.
        </p>
       <p>The outreach to gain more women and other minorities in the developement industry is a move in the right direction and a movement I want to be a part of. This desire for diversity can be seen in the overwhelming amount of scholarships offered to minorities who seek education in developement.
        </p>
     <h4>The Hunt</h4>
     <p>Finding an abundance of minority scholarships offered through specific schools was fairly quick and easy. Each bootcamp seems to offer its own variety of scholarships for those who attend their program. At the top of my google search was <a href="https://www.switchup.org/blog/bootcamp-scholarship-list-2018" target="_blank">Switchup</a>, a resource that lists of many 2018 bootcamp scholarship offerings. A <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-scholarships-for-coding-bootcamp-students" target="_blank">Quora</a> search also offered quite an extensive list of program specific scholarships. And here is a list of even more, courtesy of <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/the-definitive-list-of-programming-bootcamp-scholarships" target="_blank">Course Report</a>!
    </p>
    <p>I am looking to attend <a href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing</a>, which is not on any of those lists. It is an inperson, seven month program in the Denver area. They offer an easy $500 credit if you attend one of their <a href="https://turing.io/try-coding/" target="_blank">Try Coding</a> sessions! I did attend one, a full weekend where Saturday we covered backend development and Sunday we covered frontend development. Turing also offers both a diversity scholarship and a GI Bill. Per cohort, Turing offers two $4,000 diversity scholarships but one must inquire by emailing erin@turing.io to learn more and be enrolled to apply. I have been accepted to Turing (woo hoo!) and am working on my diversity scholarship essay! Turing also offers a new Mac Book Pro laptop with the tuition price. That's another pretty big bonus to me, as the state of my current 2008 Mac Book Pro is, well... it still turns on... but can't hold its own screen up without duct tape or a shoe... oh and not a huge deal, but it CAN'T download any newer programs or updates... pssh, details.
      </p>
     <p>Anyway, enough about my crumbling fossil of a laptop. Potentially, one could receive $4,500 to attend Turing. Unfortunately, Turing's tuition is $20,000. I don't have $15,000 between my couch cushions or in my microscopic jean pockets (women's pants, am I right?!) and do my best to remain debt free. There must be more money up for grabs from outside of each bootcamp, right?? This is proving harder to find than I thought...

       Just when I thought there was no where else to search, I get an email from my grandparents. They are living it up in their swanky 'adult dorms', aka senior center, and just happen to be neighbors with a woman who works for an oranization called <a href="http://www.peointernational.org/" target="_blank">P.E.O. International</a>, "a philanthropic organization where women CELEBRATE the advancement of women; EDUCATE women through scholarships, grants, awards, loans, and stewardship of Cottey College and MOTIVATE women to achieve their highest aspirations." Now THIS is what I'm talking about! What an amazing organization! My sister, who just graduated with her masters degree in Nurse Practioning, was connected with P.E.O. upon starting her graduate school two years ago. P.E.O. was able to provide her with a super low interest loan (about 3% interest). Most loans for higher education out there are around 10% or higher... crazy and terrifying! My sister met with a group of P.E.O. members for dinner and discussed her personal and professional life, goals, and larger aspirations. The members decided she was a wonderful canidate for P.E.O.'s support and were able to help her with her schooling through the low interest loan. I have been in contact with my grandparents neighbor and soon I should be contacted by a local Idaho Springs P.E.O. representative. Really looking foward to meeting with such an amazing group of women!

         Not directly relevant to me, or even scholarships, but as an opportunity for women, Karlie Kloss, offers coding camps and scholarships through her program, <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/programs" target="_blank">Kode with Klossy</a>, to young womens ages 13-18. Pretty darn cool! I'm 31... so...

           If scholarships are not available or perhaps not granted to you, the bootcamps are partnered with good lending programs. Some even have the option to defer payments till the end of your program, hopefully when you land that big bucks job. From what I've researched so far, these loans seem pretty simple to get, but as I mentioned earlier, the interest rates are around 10%! Something I'd love to avoid, but if I do go this route, my goal will be to hurl money at this loan and pay it off as soon as I land a job!
