     <p>'Terminal', forming, or situated at the end or extremity of something. The terminal on your computer is anything but 'the end'. It's a whole new beginning to how a human can interact with a machine.
   </p>
   <p> Perhaps I have yet to grasp the exact reason behind using the terminal over navigating my Mac computer through its beautifully designed interface, but it does seem once you learn how to move around the terminal, that navigation becomes quick, utilitarian, and 'simple'. I say 'simple' because the terminal does have its own language that appears to require lots of memorization to become familiar with. This seems to be the method by which most programmers move about their machines... I am going to do some more follow up information as to exactly why this is.
   </p>
     <p>While reading 'A Mind for Numbers', to help restructure my cognitive process to be more effecient at learning coding, the author reccamended the best way to retain new information is to not let more than 24 hrs go by without reviewing that information. Since I have found the terminal quite foriegn, I am going to attempt to interact with the terminal atleast once a day in hope the commands and method of moving around my computer soon become second nature.
   </p>
   <p> I've jumped into a fun project with some friends of mine creating an app. Dont' worry, I'll dive into the app in another post. I have been learning how to use the terminal to move around the app project and to push and pull files from github. Below I share a list of the initial commands I've been using.
<h4>Basic Commands</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>ls</b> - lists the files in the current working directory </li>
  <li><b>cd</b> - change directory</li>
  <li><b>atom .</b> - open where I am in atom</li>
  <li><b>[command] t</b> - open another terminal</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>How to Move Files Around and Check Status</h4>
  <p>Knowing where exactly you are located in the terminal and how to move around is very important.
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>git status</b> - shows if and what files have been changed</li>
    <li><b>git checkout</b> - change one branch to the other</li>
    <li><b>git checkout -b [name]</b> - create (build) a new branch, should always be done after a push</li>
    <li><b>git branch -d [name]</b> - delete a branch, keep files clean and delete branches you don't need</li>
    <li><b>git stash</b> - ??</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Get Files to the Cloud</h4>
  <p>The process to send a file to the cloud follows this order... add then commit then push.
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>git add .</b> - add all files where I am currently located in directory to be ready to commit</li>
    <li><b>git add [name of file]</b> - add that exact file to be ready to commit</li>
    <li><b>git commit -m "[message]"</b> - commits file to be pushed up into the cloud, message is mandatory and should be addressed to the person(s) you are pushing the file too with some detail about what you are pushing, often times curse words exist in these messages and this handy little <a href="http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/">program</a> captures all of them, haha</li>
    <li><b>git push</b> - pushes the file to the cloud, if it fails, just copy the text it prompts you to use and hit enter</li>
    <li><b>git pull</b> - pulls the file down from the cloud</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Server Commands</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>rails s</b> - starts server</li>
    <li><b>control c</b> - leave server</li>
    </ul>
