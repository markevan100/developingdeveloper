    <h3>Developing My Future</h3>
      <p>It's late. Tomorrow is Monday. My eyes are heavy. A <a href="https://josh.works/" target="_blank">mentor</a> of mine would be dissappointed as we discussed earlier this evening the importance of sleep. I just can not stop myself from experimenting with the html and css. This evening, my goal was to build something simple and quick, yet the desire to also have this blog be visually expressive of myself is hard to fight (the graphic design is strong with this one). But I tell myself,
      that will come. My concept with this blog is to produce thoughtful technical posts along with visually enhancing the usability and design as I learn and evolve as a developer.</p>
