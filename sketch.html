   <h3><span class="date">March 2019</span></h3>
   <p>Emily is one of my best friends. We met 13 years ago in college at the first day of ultimate frisbee tryouts.</p>
   <p>Colby is also one of my best friends. We met 10 years ago playing club ultimate frisbee after college.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is "the digital design toolkit" and is all the rage for laying out website and app flows and even creating working prototypes. We met about a week ago and ultimate frisbee was not invovled, so I'm skeptical ;)</p>
        <p>Emily and Colby will be getting married on June 1, 2019! But today, I have joined Emily, Colby, and Sketch in holy matrimony as I build a working prototype for a fun wedding suprise website <a href="https://medium.com/@markevan100" target="_blank">Mark</a> (Colby's best man) and I have dreamed up.
        </p>
        <h4>The Premise</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is for Mark and I to create gift for our two best friends while practicing our recent web developing skills. I've been working on front end skills and Mark has been working on back end skills. Naturally, we decided on a desktop website full of fun memories with our two friends! We wanted a basic home page with perhaps a photo of them and a navigation bar at the top that held fun topics, like poems and photographs. Those would then link to pages where there would be a list of funny personalized poems or cherished photographs from our friendships over the years. Pretty standard construction.
        </p>
        <h4>Going Further</h4>
        <p>
          As I've been looking more into UX/UI design, I wondered how Mark and I could make this experience really special. Could we drop what we know about conventional websites and create something more personal for our friends and their celebration? So I started brainstorming... we want to give our friends a wedding gift (a website) full of small gifts (poems, photos, etc). And their wedding is coming up, which means we are counting down the days. Huh, counting down days till a celebration... with gifts invovled. AN ADVENT CALENDAR! This website could be like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar" target="_blank">Advent calendar</a>!
        </p>
          <p>
          <image class="twoimages" src="calendar.jpg"></image><image class="twoimages" src="notebook.jpg"></image>
        </p>
        <h4>To The Races</h4>
        <p>
          I was so exicted about this idea that I jumped right into Sketch and started to design and prototype. I skipped the notebook and wireframing process, besides the one sketch photographed above, because the overall concept seemed so simple. The home page had a heading, a subheading of instructions, a grid of faces mimicking an advent calendar, and a small footer. The image on the left shows the basic homepage structure. Mark and I then discussed how neat it would be if we could lock all of the faces and each day a new one would be unlocked and made clickable. This is shown better by the image on the right. The faded out faces are locked. Each day, when a face becomes unlocked, the colors pop back up to 100%. The faces unlock left to right, top to bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
        <image class="twoimages" src="Prototype 1.png"></image><image class="twoimages" src="Prototype 1_unclicked.png"></image>
      </p>
      <p>
        The secondary pages also seemed simple. They would highlight either Emily or Colby, based on the face that with clicked on the home page. The title would simplfy to just one name, have a fun sized small head, and a countdown to help Colby and Emily keep track of the days. The body would be either text or a photo, follwed by a back button to return you to the home page, and once again, the small footer. An example of a Colby page and an Emily page show below.
      </p>

    </p>
    <h4>Reign It In</h4>
    <p>
      As my initial excitement began to relax I started to realize some flaws in my design.
    </p>
    <p>
      1) The faces unlock left to right and top to bottom. Like an advent calendar, we plan to have about a month's worth of faces. That means, about halfway through the month, the newest unlocked face would be detectable until the viewers scroll down. For an actual advent calendar, which also typically moves from left to right and top to bottom, this is ok because the viewer can see the entire calendar. Its a phyical object that can be viewed as whole. My concern with having the newest unlocked faces move below 'the fold' is that excitement will be diminished if the viewer opens the page and sees nothing new at first glance... and perhaps the new unlocked face would even be forgotten and go unopened.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) This website does require instruction at first. But the nature of this website is very repetitive. After the first day or two, the viewer will not require the instructions any longer because they will understand how the site is working. The instructions at the top of the home page take away from the simplicity of the design and push the exciting content further down the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) The countdown on the secondary pages I believe is unnecessary and therefore takes away from the simplicity of those pages as well. Because the home page is a grid, it shows all the existing gifts to be had. While it might not provide an exact countdown, the viewer can get an overall feel for the amount of days left by just a quick glance and visual comparison between the amount of faces locked and unlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) When a new face is unlocked, it blends in with the other unlocked faces. I want this new unlocked face to be exciting and to let the viewer know 'Hey, I'm new, you haven't clicked on me yet, click on me!'.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found quite a few ways to improve upon this initial design. Time back up and give it another go! I'm not sure how the theme of this post went from wedding to horseback riding, but here we are.
    </p>
    <h4>Back In The Saddle</h4>
    <p>
      A video popped up in my YouTube rabbit hole about a wireframing exersise called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz4g87XapQ0" target="_blank">Crazy Eights</a>. What a good way to get me off of the computer and doing something fun and tactile with some structure. Below are my Crazy Eights! I did one excersise for the home page (left) and one for the secondary page (right). I put a lot of thought into the issues I addressed above. And I also tried some crazier ideas, even if I didn't think they were what I was looking for, perhaps they would spark cool ideas that I didn't know were needed.
    </p>
    <p>
    <image class="twoimages" src="crazy81.jpg"></image><image class="twoimages" src="crazy82.jpg"></image>
  </p>
  <p>
    After I finished my Crazy Eights, I took time to review them all, analyze, mix and match. And still before returning to the computer, I sketched even more about the flow of the site to make sure the direction was a smooth one. I had three concepts for how the homepage could function, so below I drew out each one and listed positives and negatives for each.
      </p>
      <p>
        <image class="twoimages" src="Sketchbook2.jpg"></image><image class="twoimages" src="Sketchbook3.jpg"></image>
      </p>
      <p>
        I returned to Sketch with a clear direction. Below I will discuss my solutions to the earlier issues and then present my final working prototype!
      </p>
      <p>
        1) To address the order in which the faces unlock and to keep the newest face visible and engaging, I decided to edit how the faces functioned within the grid. Now, the newest face will always appear in the top left space, pushing older faces to the right. Once a face hits the far right spot on the page, it will move bump down to the row below, and so on. Since the faces shift, each spot now has to be prepared to hold a Colby or an Emaily face, I could no longer use faded versions of each face. I needed an element that was more universal, hence the circle. Similar to issue 1, I'll address issue 4) here. What does a person do when they are excited about something? Jump up and down. Shake with excitement. Since this is the emotion I hope to evoke when a new face is unlocked each day, I want that new face to shake back and forth before it is clicked. This will add excitement when the viewer opens the site and will be visually clear if there is a new gift the viewer has not seen yet. If the viewer misses a few days, they will open the site to 3 or 4 shaking heads. See below in my 'Frustrations About Sketch' section. This shaking animation can not be viewed in my prototype, so I created these images with screen shots, dropped into PS, then made the animations on top. As soon as I figure out how to have animations appear in the Sketch previews, I will update this post with an answer to that. The shaking new faces really does add clarity.
        </p>

      <p>
        2) The instructions are only necessary in the beginning of the viewers experience due to the sites repitition in function. For this reason, I added a page before the home page, an intro page, or what I call in the footer, a 'LOVE NOTE'. Having the introduction/instructions be on its own page allows for more space for the text and a fuller explanation. The text also offers some subtle hints as to what the coming pages will be about, but offers no other clues. I love this little build up of intrigue. In case Colby or Emily do forget the instructions or just wish to view our little message again, I provide a link in the footers of the coming pages to return to this love note.
      </p>
      <image class="twoimages" src="lovenote.jpg"></image><image class="twoimages" src="lovenote_zoom.jpg"></image>
    <p>
      3) I took out the countdowns on the secondary pages. I feel the home page provides enough context with each cirle representing a gift to come and in a better and simpler way than the text provided on the secondary pages. I really like how the circle elements provide an expectation. The viewer can scroll and see the exact number of gifts they will be receiving and can visually compare, as the faces fill up, how many gifts they have received vs how many they have left. I debated not having these circles or spot markers at all during my Crazy Eight exersise, and to simply just have the faces shift over with no markers. In that case, I'd feel like adding a counter somewhere would be necessary to give the viewer context. All in all, I think the dots are simple, elegant, and intuitive.
    </p>
    <image class="twoimages" src="secondary.png"></image><image class="twoimages" src="dots.png"></image>
    <p>
      One more element I paid closer attention to this round was the bootstrap grid. I edited my Sketch grid to match the bootstrap grid and aligned elements accordingly, in hopes when I go to build this site, my site will be well structured for the transition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, for what we've all been waiting for... my working prototype! Please image that the new face in the top left corner shakes before it's clicked on.
    </p>

          <h4>Sketch Features I Love</h4>
          <p> The ability to make objects into symbols is such a time saver! By turning an object into a symbol, universal updates of that symbol are now possible. In this site, I made my header, footer, and faces all symbols. To explain what a symbol is with an example, let's say I have yet to show this design to Mark, and when I do, Mark thinks the cartoon face I drew of Colby needs different color eyes. Instead of updating each and every Colby face individually, since his face is a symbol, all I have to do is edit one face, and all of Colby's faces will update with that edit automatically! Wow, I said 'faces' a lot.
            </p>
              <p>Protoyping is the coolest! Especially being new to designing digital and interactive projects. Actually being able to move around what I've designed helps me understand the flow infinitely better then simply moving my eyes from artboard to artboard, pretending. Being able to prototype my initial design and see how it flowed or didn't flow really helped me see what edited were required for round two. The process of dragging the arrows around the project to show the flow and create the clickable working prototype is insanely easy as well. Just a few clicks. I sat down and expected it to take hours to set up... nope, minutes.
              </p>
      <h4>Sketch Frustrations I Have</h4>
      <p>A vision I have with this project is having the little faces dance back and forth before they are clicked on for the first time. A way to depict that a face has not been interacted with yet and attract the user's attention. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBGFeXbBrq3W9_0oNLJREQ" target="_blank">Jesse Showalter</a> is one of the many YouTube channels I am subscribed too. When looking to animate my Sketch prototype, he of course had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJqPVOapq7A" target="_blank">video</a> on how to do it. In the video, he downloads a plugin called <a href="https://timeline.animaapp.com/">anima</a> to specifically use the Timeline feature. Timeline allows you to animate directly in Sketch. Creating an animation was super easy. But I had a problem after creating an animation. I could not actually see the animation on my artboards or even in prototype mode (which is really when I wanted the animation to work). The animation just looked like a still image. The animation worked in the 'Preview in Brower' option in the anima tool bar, but I also did not get the desired effect here (my heading text color was reversed from black to white, ugh). I watched a bunch of other tutorials and none showed how the final product of an anima animation was actually used on a Sketch artboard. My assumption is that the animation must be exported as a GIF then pasted onto the desired artboard in Sketch...? I downloaded the free trial of anima and downloading your animation as a GIF is not an option. So I am going to pop on over to Illustrator and Photoshop, and make my GIF there.
        </p>
        <p>Well first off, leaving Sketch and using Illustrator and Photoshop to create a GIF is quite an annoying process. When I was first trying to figure out the animation in Sketch/anima, I thought, I should just do it the way I know how, it will be much easier and probably be faster. Wrong. Compared to the time it took me to make my animation in Sketch, it took quite a bit longer doing it 'my way'... 1 min in Sketch vs 5 mins in the Adobe products. And when I tried to import or paste my new GIF into my Sketch artboards, my GIF still is not animating. Hmmm? To be continued...
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the Sketch preview stops working every once and a while and I need to restart Sketch. Annoying.
          </p>
    <h4>Next Steps</h4>
    <p> I plan to share this post with others and receive feedback. I will make the appropriate edits to the prototype. Then it will be time to build the front end of this site while Mark works on the back end. I'd love to design the secondary pages a bit more. And hopefully Mark can build the lock out/unlock functionality. Also, hopefully I can make the site responsive. Alot of hopes, we will see, if we can not figure certain elements out, we'll figure out the best way around those issues! About a month before Colby and Emily's wedding, we will share our gift with them! Stay tuned for more!
