     <p>Ah, when you read 'Sketch', I bet you thought of something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqRbDBq6xBg" target="_blank">this</a>. When I typed 'Sketch', what I meant was <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">this</a>.
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is "the digital design toolkit" and is all the rage for laying out website and app flows and even creating working prototypes. I am just diving into the program, coming from over a decade of Illustrator and Photoshop practice. As I become more familiar with Sketch, its capabilites, and its benefits, I'll be able to write a sexier 'one-liner' for Sketch's dating profile.
        </p>
        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p>I choose a small personal project to help me become familiar with Sketch and all its capabilites. It's a simple, fun website <a href="https://medium.com/@markevan100" target="_blank">Mark</a> and I are creating for our two best friends, Colby and Emily, who are getting married... adorable right?! I'll show examples of my early progress in Sketch shortly.
          </p>
          <h4>Features I Love</h4>
          <p> The ability to make objects into symbols is such a time saver! By turning an object into a symbol, universal updates of that symbol are now possible. In my personal project, I made my header, footer, and faces all symbols. WHen I say faces, I do mean cartoon faces of Emily and Colby that will repeat, about thirty times on the home page. Intrigued? Patience dear reader. To explain what a symbol is with an example, let's say I have yet to show this design to Mark, and when I do, Mark thinks the cartoon face I drew of Colby needs different color eyes. Instead of updating each and every Colby face individually, since his face is a symbol, all I have to do is edit one face, and all of Colby's faces will update with that edit automatically! Wow, I said faces a lot.
            </p>
            <p>Protoyping is the coolest! Especially being new to designing digital and interactive projects. Actually being able to move around what I've designed helps me understand the flow infinitely better then simply moving my eyes from artboard to artboard, pretending. The process of dragging the arrows around the project to show the flow and create the clickable working prototype is insanely easy as well. Just a few clicks. I sat down and expected it to take hours... nope, minutes. Can't wait to share my first prototype... once I figure out how to export and load it into this entry.
              </p>
      <h4>Trying to Enhance Capabilities with Plugins</h4>
      <p>A vision I have with this project is having the little faces dance back and forth before they are clicked on for the first time. A way to depict that a face has not been interacted with yet and attract the user's attention. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBGFeXbBrq3W9_0oNLJREQ" target="_blank">Jesse Showalter</a> is one of the many YouTube channels I am subscribed too. When looking to animate my Sketch prototype, he of course had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJqPVOapq7A" target="_blank">video</a> on how to do it. In the video, he downloads a plugin called <a href="https://timeline.animaapp.com/">anima</a> to specifically use the Timeline feature. Timeline allows you to animate directly in Sketch. Creating an animation was super easy. But I had a problem after creating an animation. I could not actually see the animation on my artboards or even in prototype mode (which is really when I wanted the animation to work). The animation just looked like a still image. The animation worked in the 'Preview in Brower' option in the anima tool bar, but I also did not get the desired effect here (my heading text color was reversed, weird). I watched a bunch of other tutorials and none showed how the final product of an anima animation was actually used on a Sketch artboard. My assumption is that the animation must be exported as a GIF then pasted onto the desired artboard in Sketch...? I downloaded the free trial of anima and downloading your animation as a GIF is not an option. So I am going to pop on over to Illustrator and Photoshop, and make my GIF there.
        </p>
        <p>Well first off, leaving Sketch and using Illustrator and Photoshop to create a GIF is quite an annoying process. When I was first trying to figure out the animation in Sketch/anima, I thought, I should just do it the way I know how, it will be much easier and probably be faster. Wrong. Compared to the time it took me to make my animation in Sketch, it took quite a bit longer doing it 'my way'... 1 min in Sketch vs 5 mins in the Adobe products. And when I tried to import or paste my new GIF into my Sketch artboards, my GIF still is not animating. Hmmm? To be continued...
